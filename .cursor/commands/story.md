# Story

Single entry point for the Fabric story SDLC:

**Plan → Manual Approval → Implement → Code Review → Ship (PR)**

```
/story 42
```

Delegates to **planner-agent** (which uses **story-to-requirements**) and **implementer**.

## Phase 1: Plan (PlannerAgent)

Follow **planner-agent** (`.cursor/agents/planner-agent.md`), which delegates requirement authoring to **story-to-requirements**.

**Then STOP.** Do not implement in the same turn.

---

## Approval gate (manual — human only)

Handled by **planner-agent** Steps 4–5. The agent must:

- Present the approval summary and **STOP**
- **Wait for human reply** — never self-approve

### If `Revise: ...`

Re-run **planner-agent** / **story-to-requirements** (planner-agent § On revision request).

### If `Cancel`

Acknowledge and end.

### If `Approved`

Proceed to promotion, then Phase 2.

---

## Promotion (on Approved)

Follow **planner-agent** § On human approval:

1. Copy draft → `.ai/plans/story-{id}.md`
2. Set `**Status:** Approved` with approval metadata
3. Warn if 🔴 blocking open questions remain (human overrode by approving)

Do **not** post a GitHub issue comment unless the user explicitly asks — see **github-work**.

---

## Phase 2: Implement (ImplementerAgent)

Triggered when the human replies **`Approved`** after Phase 1.

**Prerequisites:**

- Approved plan at `.ai/plans/story-{id}.md` with `**Status:** Approved`
- If missing: **STOP** — run `/story {id}` first

Follow **implementer** (`.cursor/skills/implementer/SKILL.md`):

1. Context validation
2. Impact analysis
3. Implementation (plan steps only)
4. Testing (lint, build, unit tests)
5. Self-review
6. Handover → `.ai/implementation/story-{id}.md`

**Rules (Phases 1–6):** No commits, no PRs, no scope outside plan, no AC/architecture changes. **STOP** after handover for code review.

---

## Phase 3: Ship (after code review approval)

Triggered when the human approves the implementation after review (e.g. `Approved`, `Create PR`, `Ship it`).

**Prerequisites:**

- Handover at `.ai/implementation/story-{id}.md` with status **Ready for review**
- Explicit human code review approval in chat

Follow **implementer** Phase 7 (`.cursor/skills/implementer/SKILL.md`):

1. Checkout `main` and pull (if not already on the story feature branch)
2. Create or checkout `feature/{NNNN}-{short-desc}`
3. Commit with **github-work** message format
4. Push and open PR targeting `main` (summary, changes, test plan)
5. Share the PR URL in chat — **do not** comment on the issue unless the user explicitly asks (**github-work**)

**Rules:** Never ship without human code review approval. Use **github-work** for all GitHub operations.

---

## Usage

```text
/story 42
```

After planning, review the draft plan and reply:

```text
Approved
```

---

## Outputs

| Phase | File |
|-------|------|
| Plan | `.ai/plan/issue-{id}-{slug}.md` |
| Context | `.ai/context/story-{id}.md` |
| Approved plan | `.ai/plans/story-{id}.md` |
| Implementation | `.ai/implementation/story-{id}.md` |
| PR | GitHub (after Phase 3 ship) |

## Final chat summary (after Phase 2)

1. Draft plan path
2. Approved plan path
3. Implementation handover path
4. Status: Ready for review | Blocked
5. Test results and AC coverage
6. Reviewer focus areas

## Final chat summary (after Phase 3)

1. Feature branch name
2. Commit message(s)
3. PR URL
4. Issue comment confirmed
